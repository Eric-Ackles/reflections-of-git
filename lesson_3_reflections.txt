When would you want to use a remote repository rather than keeping all your work local?

    1) When I want to share the project to others.
    2) When I want to collaborate with others.

Why might you want to always pull changes manually rather than having Git automatically 
stay up-to-date with your remote repository?

    1) If several people work on the same piece of code at the same time, it will be a mess.
    2) The features may be just experimental, and Git cannot be sure that I want them.

Describe the differences between forks, clones, and branches. When would you use one instead of another?

    1) Forking is only available on github.
    2) Cloning's repository can be either local or remote.
    3) Branches is not operating on repositories, but on commits.

What is the benefit of having a copy of the last known state of the remote stored locally?

    1) You can keep the same pace with your collaborators.
    2) You can resolve conflicts when the differences are small.

How would you collaborate without using Git or GitHub? What would be easier, and what would be harder?
    1) Any other commnunication tool can do the job.
    2) Speaking directly may make be faster.
    3) Using pull requests you can record the whole process together with the repository.
